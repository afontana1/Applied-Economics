    "#### The Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson’s Product‐Moment Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "* Provides a measure of the degree of linear relationship.\n",
    "* We refer to it as the 'correlation coefficient'\n",

    "Let's review the sample variance of variable $x$. Of course, I'm truncating our notation as $x$ is a set of samples a locations in our modeling space, $x(\\bf{u_\\alpha}), \\, \\forall \\, \\alpha = 0, 1, \\dots, n - 1$.\n",

    "We now have a measure that represents the manner in which variables $x$ and $y$ co-vary or vary together.  We can standardized the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of $x$ and $y$ to calculate the correlation coefficent. \n",
