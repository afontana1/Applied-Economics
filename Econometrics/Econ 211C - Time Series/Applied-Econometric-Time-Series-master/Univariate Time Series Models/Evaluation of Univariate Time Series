" We will attempt to model the US CPI inflation rate in compounded annual rate of
change. You can download this data in Microsoft Excel from
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL. Use “EDIT GRAPH” and change the “Units”
to “Percent Change from Year Ago”. We will use the monthly data from the 1st of
January 1970 to the 1st of January 2018. (This can be adjusted on the main graph
window before clicking “DOWNLOAD”.)

## The process as a whole appears non-stationary: There is no obvious mean over the sample
## The process seems to be trending downwards

" Considerations:
  
  1970s: High and variable inflation partly due to the oil shocks
  Currently: US Federal Reserve Bank Inflation rate stable at a 2%
  Therefore we could be looking at two completely different Data Generating Processes"

# ------------------
#  Autocorrelation
# ------------------

## To show how different the process is in its early and later phases --> truncate the data at beg of 1992

# Convert the data frame to a time series object

CPI_percent_change <- ts(inflation$CPIAUCSL_PC1, start=1970, frequency = 12)

# Truncate the time series object

CPI_percent_change_truncated <- window(CPI_percent_change, start = 1992)

acf(CPI_percent_change)
" The zero-th autocorrelation is alwyas 1 - a variable is alwyas perfectly corr with itself
## The ACF of the whole sample of the inflation variabele is typcial of a non-stationary process:
## Auto-correlations are very close to 1 and slowly fade
## A shock in some months will still have an impact on the current level more than two years into 
## the future (Oil crisis 1973)
"
acf(CPI_percent_change_truncated)

"
  The ACF for the truncated time series is more typical of a somewhat persistent stationary process:
  A rapidly ACF (suggesting further evidence that the time series behaviour has changed over time)
"

# --------------------------
#  Partial Autocorrelation
# --------------------------


pacf(CPI_percent_change)
pacf(CPI_percent_change_truncated)

" There seems to be no substansive difference in the PACFs of the two processes
  There is a strong impact of the first lag (PACF by default drops the 0th lag)
  There is strong negative impact on the second lag which is conditional on the first
  There is strong impact of the 13th lag
  Several other lags are just barely significant
  An AR model may be useful but no significant conclusion although the AR must have significant lags 
  to capture the time series  properties of the data."

#  Augmented Dickey-Fuller Tests:

"Hypothesis tested:
  The first part is non-stationary enough to make the whole process non-stationary
  The second part is stationary"

adf.test(CPI_percent_change)
## p-value greater than 1% -> do not reject the null of non-stationarity == NON-STATIONARY
adf.test(CPI_percent_change_truncated)
## p-value less than 1% -> reject the null of non-stationarity == STATIONARY

#    KPSS Test

kpss.test(CPI_percent_change)
kpss.test(CPI_percent_change_truncated)

" Fit a simple AR model with 12 lags, no differencing, no moving average terms
 ----> ARIMA(12,0,0) on the time frame 1990-2013"

AR_model <- arima(window(CPI_percent_change,start = 1990, end = 2013), order = c(12,0,0), method = "ML")
summary(AR_model)
## None of the coefficients are statistically significant (not a parsimonious model)

# THE AR MODEL IS NOT SUFFICIENT

# ---------------
#  Box-Pierce
# ---------------

" The Box=Pierce test is one of a range of tests for serial correlation.
  If the case would be that all the autocorrelations of a process up to lag 12
  were zero the error terms are white noise"

Box.test(AR_model$residuals, lag = 12)

## Here we reject the H0 that the errors are white noise and therefore there is persistence
## or too much autocorrelation in inflation to be captured by a simple AR model

# THERE IS PERSISTENCE IN THE RESIDUALS THERFORE MUST INCLUDE AN MA PROCESS

# ---------------
#     ARIMA
# ---------------

ARIMA_model <- arima(window(CPI_percent_change, start = 1990, end =2013), order = c(12,2,2),
                     method = "ML")
summary(ARIMA_model)

"## Some of the coefficients are significant, the SE being 2x smaller
The residuals tests as white noise at a 5% level. This is still not a parsimonious model,
as there are many insignificant coefficients to zero. In practice, it can be very hard to
find a good single equation model for a time series this persistent with such different
behavior over time.

AR_model <- ar(window(CPI_percent_change, start = 1990, end = 2013), order = 12,
               method = "mle")
AR_forecast <- predict(AR_model, n.ahead = 72, se.fit = TRUE)

## AR_forecast contains predicted value of the series and the SE of the forecast

plot(window(CPI_percent_change, start=1992))

lines(AR_forecast$pred + 2 *AR_forecast$se, col = "cornflowerblue", lty = "dashed")
lines(AR_forecast$pred - 2 * AR_forecast$se, col = "cornflowerblue", lty = "dashed")

"As expected, this is not a very strong model. It
seems to get the mean right, but with a very large amount of uncertainty around it.
With a series as persistent as this, containing periods of such large volatility, we cannot
expect simple time series models to work well. "
