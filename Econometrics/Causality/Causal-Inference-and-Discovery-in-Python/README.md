**Unlock the secrets of modern causal machine learning with DoWhy, EconML, PyTorch and more**

## What is this book about?

Causal methods present unique challenges compared to traditional machine learning and statistics. Learning causality can be challenging, but it offers distinct advantages that elude a purely statistical mindset. Causal Inference and Discovery in Python helps you unlock the potential of causality.

You‚Äôll start with basic motivations behind causal thinking and a comprehensive introduction to Pearlian causal concepts, such as structural causal models, interventions, counterfactuals, and more. Each concept is accompanied by a theoretical explanation and a set of practical exercises with Python code.

Next, you‚Äôll dive into the world of causal effect estimation, consistently progressing towards modern machine learning methods. Step-by-step, you‚Äôll discover Python causal ecosystem and harness the power of cutting-edge algorithms. You‚Äôll further explore the mechanics of how ‚Äúcauses leave traces‚Äù and compare the main families of causal discovery algorithms.

The final chapter gives you a broad outlook into the future of causal AI where we examine challenges and opportunities and provide you with a comprehensive list of resources to learn more.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Master the fundamental concepts of causal inference
* Decipher the mysteries of structural causal models
* Unleash the power of the 4-step causal inference process in Python
* Explore advanced uplift modeling techniques
* Unlock the secrets of modern causal discovery using Python
* Use causal inference for social impact and community benefit

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
preds = causal_bert.inference(
    texts=df['text'],
    confounds=df['has_photo'],
)[0]
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is for machine learning engineers, data scientists, and machine learning researchers looking to extend their data science toolkit and explore causal machine learning. It will also help developers familiar with causality who have worked in another technology and want to switch to Python, and data scientists with a history of working with traditional causality who want to learn causal machine learning. It‚Äôs also a must-read for tech-savvy entrepreneurs looking to build a competitive edge for their products and go beyond the limitations of traditional machine learning.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).

# Note from the Author:

## Environment installation
1. See the section **Using `graphviz` and GPU** below

2. To install the basic environment run: `conda env create -f causal_book_py39_cuda117.yml`

3. To install the environment for notebook `Chapter_11.2.ipynb` run: `conda create -f causal-pymc.yml`

## Selecting the kernel
After a successful installation of the environment, open your notebook and select the kernel `causal_book_py39_cuda117`

For notebook `Chapter_11.2.ipynb` change kernel to `causal-pymc`

## Using `graphviz` and GPU

**Note**: Depending on your system settings, you might need to install `graphviz` manually in order to recreate the graph plots in the code. 
Check https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/ for instructions 
specific to your operating system.

**Note 2**: To use GPU you'll need to install CUDA 11.7 drivers.
This can be done here: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-7-0-download-archive
