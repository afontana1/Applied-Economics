# Notes on Causal Inference

When learning about new things, I find it helps to write explicit notes on what I am trying to understand. These are my note for trying to understand "Causal Inference", or how we can make questions like "What effect does changing $X$ have on $Y$?" precise. I am not an expert on the subject, for a popular account from an expert I suggest Pearl's [The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36204378-the-book-of-why). For a more mathematical account, I suggest [Elements of Causal Inference](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-causal-inference).
