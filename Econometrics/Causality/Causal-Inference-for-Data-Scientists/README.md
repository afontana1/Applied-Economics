## 3rd Party Resources

In addition to any material I adapt and create in the repo, here is a running list of resources which I have found valuable as I've skilled up in Causal Inference.

### Books

- [Mastering the 'Metrics](https://amzn.to/2VmVHVe) - Probably the best place to start. Provides an approachable introduction to Causal Inference and the primary tools used by econometricians.
- [Mostly Harmless Econometrics](https://amzn.to/2VJ5N22) - A more thorough introduction to Econometrics. Very approachable, but a little more math heavy than _Mastering the 'Metrics_

### Videos

Ben Lambert has made a ton of [fantastic videos on Econometrics](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpartacanUsuals/playlists). He has done both undergraduate and graduate level. I found these videos super useful as quick refreshers or when I needed an alternative explanation of various topics. Definitely worth bookmarking.
