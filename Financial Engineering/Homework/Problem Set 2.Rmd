# Question 1
Suppose that you own 2500 shares of Apple stock.

### a. (15 points)
Obtain data for the period 01 Jan 2017 - 31 Mar 2017 and estimate the hedge ratio for your portfolio. Use the 3-month U.S. T-bill for the risk-free interest rate. [Notes: (1) T-bill rates are expressed in annual terms - you will need to deannulaize to daily frequency; (2) Do not average the T-bill values - use them day-by-day.]

#### Solution:

$$\text{Calculate the returns} \frac{\delta P}{P_0}$$

$$r_f=\frac{APR}{(365*100)}$$

```{r warnings=F, messages=F, include=TRUE}

rf = Quandl("FRED/DTB3", start_date="2017-01-01", end_date="2017-03-31",type="xts",order=c("asc"))

getSymbols(c("AAPL","^GSPC"), from="2017-01-01", to="2017-03-31")

AAPLreturn<-dailyReturn(AAPL)
GSPCreturn<-dailyReturn((GSPC))

rf<-rf/(365*100)

# Excess Return

ExcessAppPort<-AAPLreturn-rf
ExcessGSPCMarket<-GSPCreturn-rf

data<-data.frame(ExcessAppPort,ExcessGSPCMarket,rf)


reg<-lm(ExcessAppPort~ExcessGSPCMarket,data)
summary(reg)
hedge<-reg$coefficients[2]
print(hedge)

```

### b. (10 points)
How many E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts would you purchase or sell in order to hedge your portfolio on 31 Mar 2017?

#### Solution:

$$N*=\beta*\frac{V_p}{V_{e-mini}}$$

```{r,warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=TRUE}

ES1<-Quandl("CHRIS/CME_ES1",start_date="2017-03-31", end_date="2017-03-31",type="xts")
APP<-(2500*AAPL[62,4])
EMIN<-50*ES1$Last
N=hedge*(APP/EMIN)
print(N)


```

### c. (10 points)
Suppose you would like to synthesize a portfolio beta of 1. What strategy would you employ?

#### Solution:

$$N*=(\beta-\beta*)*\frac{V_p}{V_{e-mini}}$$

$$\beta* \text{will be set equal to 1}$$

```{r,include=TRUE}
contract<-(hedge-1)*(APP/EMIN)
print(contract)
```

# Question 2 (15 points)
Sixty futures contracts are used to hedge an exposure to the price of silver. Each futures contract is on $5,000$ ounces of silver. At the time the hedge is closed out, the basis is $\$0.20$ per ounce. What is the effect of the basis on the hedgerâs financial position if (a) the trader is hedging the purchase of silver and (b) the trader is hedging the sale of silver?

#### Solution:

$$Basis=S_T-F_T$$

$$60 * 5000 *.2 = 60000$$

####a
The effect of the basis in this example is bad. The hedger is going to purchase silver in the future at a higher price than he would have. The basis increases the cost of the purchase $$\$60000-\$50000$$



####b
When you hedge the sale of silver the basis is a positive effect on you. You are selling in the future at a higher price so the net gain will be $$\$60,000-\$50,000$$


# Question 3
### a. (5 points)
Suppose that LIBOR rates for maturities of $1,2,3,4,5$, and $6$ months are $2.6\%$, $2.9\%$, $3.1\%$, $3.2\%$, $3.25\%$, and $3.3\%$ with continuous compounding. What are the forward rates for future 1-month periods?

#### Solution:

$$r_f=\frac{R_t*T_t-R_{t-1}*T_{t-1}}{T_t-T_{t-1}}$$

```{r,warnings=F,messages=F}

forwardrate<-function(R2,R1,T2,T1){
  forward<-((R2*T2)-(R1*T1))/(T2-T1)
  print(forward)
}

forwardrate(2.9,2.6,2,1)
forwardrate(3.1,2.9,3,2)
forwardrate(3.2,3.1,4,3)
forwardrate(3.25,3.2,5,4)
forwardrate(3.3,3.25,6,5)

```


### b. (5 points)
Prove that a forward rate is strictly larger (smaller) than the two zero rates used to calculate the forward rate when the slope of zero curve at the interval is strictly positive (negative).  

#### Solution:

$$r_f=r_2+(r_2-r_1)\frac{t_1}{t_2-t_1}$$

$$r_2>r_1$$
In this case, the slope of the curve will be positive. This shows that $r_f$ will be strictly greater than the zero rates used in the equation because $r_2$ + some positive number will always be bigger.

$$r_2<r_1$$
In this case, the slope of the curve will be negative. This shows that $r_f$ will be strictly less than the zero rates used in the equation becuase $r_2$ + some negative number will always be smaller. 


If the zero curve is upward sloping between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$, $r_{f} > r_{2} > r_{1}$

If the zero curve is downward sloping between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}, r_{f} < r_{2} < r_{1}$


### c. (5 points)
Suppose you can borrow or lend at LIBOR rates. Explain how you can lock in the forward rate for future 1-month period starting in a month.

#### Solution:

$$
e^{0.026(\frac{1}{12})} = 1.0021699\\
e^{0.029(\frac{2}{12})} = 1.004845\\
1.0021699e^{r{(\frac{1}{12}})} = 1.004845\\
ln(e^{r(\frac{1}{12})}) = ln(1.002669)\\
r(\frac{1}{12}) = .002666\\
r = (.002666) \cdot 12 = .03199
$$



# Question 4 (15 points)
It is March 10, 2017 today. The cheapest-to-deliver bond in a December 2017 Treasury bond futures contract is an 8\% coupon bond, and delivery is expected to be made on December 31, 2017. Coupon payments on the bond are made on March 1 and September 1 each year. The rate of interest with continuous compounding is 5% per annum for all maturities. The conversion factor for the bond is 1.2191. The current quoted bond price is $137. Calculate the quoted futures price for the contract.

#### Solution:

Spot Price $= 137 + [\frac{9}{9+173}]*(\frac{8}{2}) = 137.198$

PV Coupon  
$$= \frac{173}{365} = .47397 $$

$$ 4e^{-0.05(.47397)} = 3.906 $$

$$F_{0}:  \frac{296}{365} = .81096 \rightarrow (137.198 - 3.906)e^{.05 \cdot .81096} = 138.808$$

At expiration, there are 122 days of accrued interest

Quoted Futures Price 

$$= 138.808 - 4(\frac{122}{122+61}) = 136.141$$

Conversion Factor, Quoted Futures Price for the Contract = 

$$\frac{136.141}{1.2191} = 111.67$$

# Question 5

Suppose that it is April 27, 2017 and the quoted price of a December, 2017 expiry Eurodollar futures contract is 98.52.

### a. 5 (points)
What is the expiry date of the futures contract?

#### Solution:

The CME Group specifies that expiry is the 2nd business day prior to the third Wednesday of December. Therefore, we are using expiry of Monday, December 18, 2017

### b. (5 points)
What is the implied forward rate and for what period does it apply? Express the rate per year and in terms of the actual period.

#### Solution:

The rate per year is the APR : 

$$P = 100-98.52 = 1.48\%$$


The actual period, or the 3-month rate following expiry of said contract, is the quarterly compounded APR:

$$\frac{1.48}{4} = 0.37\%$$

### c. (5 points)
What is the cash price of the contract?

#### Solution:

$$
\text{Contract Price:} P = (100-.25R)* 10,000\\
P = (100 - .25(100-Q)) * 10,000\\
P = (100-.25(100-98.52)) * 10,000\\
P = (100 - .37)*10,000= 996,300 
$$

### d. (5 points)
If the price of the futures contract falls, who benefits and why?

#### Solution:

The borrower benefits. If the price of a future contract falls that means the interest rate has risen. This is good for the borrower because he/she locked in a lower rate on the contract. If the borrower didnt borrow, and decided to in the future, he would have to take a higher rate. The lender could have lent at a higher rate but instead lent at the lower rate like a chump.
